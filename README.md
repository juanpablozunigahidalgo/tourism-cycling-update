# About-the-update. 

Long time ago. I developed an html / javascript / website. However. I decedided to move it to react - typescript . 
The old project remains available at. 
https://github.com/juanpablozunigahidalgo/toursimcycling.github.io.oldversion
www.tourismcycling.com

I make this project to apply MUI design libriaries. To build a complete website based on design libriaries instead. 
The challenge now. For this one. Is to have a user registration page. In which cyclists can register themselves in case optional. 

I kept minimalistic design principle. And usability focus. 

# open-invite

Hello! . This is an open source project for coders who love cycling.

# Project Name: Tourism cycling

# For who?

Coders who love Cycling long routes.
Coders whose want to help cyclists with digital tools to plan their trips.

# Vision:

GOAL.
Develop an minimalistic, useful and accurate website, and app, for touring cyclists. In which the adventurer cyclists
can use to prepare their trips.

Sub-deliveries:

[1] Touring cyclists can estimate time needed for trips. Depending on the route between two locations.
And their average speed. (Which depends based on their energy output).

[2] Touring cyclists can estimate the cost of that trip. Depending on the trip length and
geographical location (countries).

[3] Touring cyclists can get the list of equipment needed. Minimum required. Minimalistic principle.
Based on their trip duration [1]. Camping option. And weather conditions.
Also. Provide a link and recommend cheap but high quality products.

[4] Provide an easy to access knowledge base to sustain the trip. Both biological preparation (body).
But also, bike mechanical preparation.
