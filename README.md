# About-the-update. 


The live version of the website can be accessed at https://www.tourismcycling.com. The current repository for this version, built with React and TypeScript, is available at: https://github.com/juanpablozunigahidalgo/toursimcycling.github.io.

I created this project to utilize the MUI design libraries and develop a comprehensive website based on these design principles. A future challenge involves implementing a user registration page where cyclists can optionally register themselves, while maintaining a minimalistic design approach and focusing on usability. Currently, the website retrieves data exclusively through Auth0-login for optional profile information.

Previously, I developed a website using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. However, I decided to migrate it to React with TypeScript. The old version of the project is still accessible at https://github.com/juanpablozunigahidalgo/toursimcycling.github.io.oldversion, and you can view the live page of the old version at https://juanpablozunigahidalgo.github.io/toursimcycling.github.io.oldversion/.


# open-invite

Hello! . This is an open source project for coders who love cycling.

# Project Name: Tourism cycling

# For who?

Coders who love Cycling long routes.
Coders whose want to help cyclists with digital tools to plan their trips.

# Vision:

GOAL.
Develop an minimalistic, useful and accurate website, and app, for touring cyclists. In which the adventurer cyclists
can use to prepare their trips.

Sub-deliveries:

[1] Touring cyclists can estimate time needed for trips. Depending on the route between two locations.
And their average speed. (Which depends based on their energy output).

[2] Touring cyclists can estimate the cost of that trip. Depending on the trip length and
geographical location (countries).

[3] Touring cyclists can get the list of equipment needed. Minimum required. Minimalistic principle.
Based on their trip duration [1]. Camping option. And weather conditions.
Also. Provide a link and recommend cheap but high quality products.

[4] Provide an easy to access knowledge base to sustain the trip. Both biological preparation (body).
But also, bike mechanical preparation.


# Would you like to be part of this exciting project?

You are more than welcome to help!. I am an amateur coder but I love cycling.
I am learning everyday. And it is a pleasure of mine to help other people. Specially in this sport which
is so nice.
You can help by contributing to the Open Canvas. With ideas and code. And potential modifications.
We are building. Please invite other users who may be interested in contributing to open source!
